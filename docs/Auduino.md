# Introduction

The Auduino is a sound synthesiser based on the [Arduino
platform](http://arduino.cc). It works on all Arduinos running at
16MHz - everything from the original Arduino serial to the Arduino Mega.
It uses granular synthesis techniques to generate a distinctive
filter-sweep sound that had much more character than boring square
waves.

# Synthesis model {#synthesis_model}

Sound is generated by playing the same noise (\'grain\') repeatedly at
very high speed. This merges into a tone that is an audible hybrid of
the repetition rate and the original grain. It sounds quite similar to
an oscillator with two resonating bandpass filters, although the
different architecture means there are lots of additional interesting
noises at parameter extremes.

The grain consists of two triangular waves of adjustable frequency, and
adjustable decay rate. This is based on FOF synthesis model, but using
triangle waves instead of sine and using a rectangular window.

The repetition rate is set by another control.

# Programming the Arduino {#programming_the_arduino}

Download the source code from the the [Tinker.it Google Code
site.](http://code.google.com/p/tinkerit) Load it into the Arduino
environment, set up your board type and serial port, then hit the Upload
button. Done. If you\'ve never used Arduino before, you\'ll need to
download the development software from [the Arduino
site](http://arduino.cc).

# Construction

Auduino uses 5 controls. You can use anything that generates a 0-5V
analogue signal, but the prototype uses five 4.7Kohm linear
potentiometers. Connect one side of each potentiometer to GND. Connect
the other side to the 5V pin on Arduino. Connect the middle (wiper) pins
to Analog inputs 0 to 4 on the Arduino.

The audio comes out of Digital pin 3 (or pin 11 on ATmega8 Arduinos).
The prototype uses a 1/4\" jack socket, with the tip connected to pin 3
(or 11 on ATmega8\'s) and the shield connected to GND. Plug the other
end into an audio amplifier, and you\'re good to go.

The Arduino can drive a small piezo, speaker or headphones directly.
Strictly speaking it outputs at 5V rather than the 1V line level, but
most amplifiers don\'t seem to mind.

We now have a group on [Google

# Auduino controller hacks {#auduino_controller_hacks}

The Auduino can take any analogue signal and make it audible. Add a
[Light Dependent
Resistor](http://www.rapidonline.com/Electronic-Components/Optoelectronics/Photodetectors/Miniature-light-dependent-resistor/29399/kw/light%20dependent%20resistor),
you have an instant theremin. Add a [linear
softpot](http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=8607),
instant keyboard or ribbon controller. The [Arduino
Playground](http://www.arduino.cc/playground/) is a great place to get
new ideas.

# Auduino software hacks {#auduino_software_hacks}

Have a look at the loop() function. The controllers are mapped to the
synthesiser parameters there. You can really customise the controllers
there - adding different musical scales, vibrato, envelopes - whatever
takes your fancy.

Start by playing with the pitch mapping. Three mappings are available to
start with. Uncomment the one you prefer: `{{{
// Smooth frequency mapping
//syncPhaseInc = mapPhaseInc(analogRead(SYNC_CONTROL)) / 4;

// Stepped mapping to MIDI notes: C, Db, D, Eb, E, F...
//syncPhaseInc = mapMidi(analogRead(SYNC_CONTROL));

// Stepped pentatonic mapping: D, E, G, A, B
syncPhaseInc = mapPentatonic(analogRead(SYNC_CONTROL));
}}}`{=mediawiki}

syncPhaseInc is proportional to frequency, so the /4 above drops the
pitch to a quarter, or two octaves.

# Auduino hardcore hacking {#auduino_hardcore_hacking}

If you\'re really into algorithmic synthesis, have a poke around in the
interrupt routine at the bottom of the source code. You\'ll have to be
careful to keep the routine fast, but there is plenty of spare CPU to
implement other synthesis techniques.

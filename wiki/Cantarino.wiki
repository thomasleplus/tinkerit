= Introduction =

Cantarino is a software speech synthesiser for Arduino. It is still a work in progress, but a tech demo that runs on Arduino is now available.

= Demo =

==[http://vimeo.com/5577046 Demo video]==

Demo presented at Music Hack Day is [http://tinkerit.googlecode.com/files/speech_daisybell.pde downloadable here]. (If you downloaded before 15 July, download again for bugfixed version). Audio out is on Arduino pin 3. A schematic is at the end of the video.

= Community =

This is a work in progress. Sign up to [http://groups.google.com/group/cantarino the Google Group] to watch or guide Cantarino's development.

= Technical: Formant synthesiser =

An interrupt on the PWM output timer calls a sample generator. This uses a synthesis similar to FOF or granule synthesis - using two sines and a square wave of adjustable pitch and amplitude, synced and enveloped by a pitch of selectable frequency. Phase modulation is added to the pitch, to allow unvoiced phonemes to be uttered.

= Phoneme codebook =

The following phonemes are currently supported, based on data from the SAM Apple ][ synthesiser.
